    "'''\n",
    "    In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.\n",
    "    When an exception occurs, the program immediately stops executing and raises an exception object,\n",
    "    which contains information about the error.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "'''\n",
    "    Both Exceptions and Syntax errors are types of errors that can occur in Python programming. \n",
    "    However, they are different in their causes and how they are handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1- Syntax errors are caused by incorrect syntax in the code, while exceptions are caused by unexpected events during the program's execution.\n",
    "    2- Syntax errors prevent the code from running at all, while exceptions can be handled by the program to prevent the program from crashing.\n",
    "    3- Syntax errors are usually detected by the Python interpreter before the code is executed, while exceptions are detected during runtime.\n",
